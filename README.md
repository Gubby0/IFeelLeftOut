Puck mod to allow goalies to view the opposing offensive zone so they don't feel left out :(

This mod should be compatible with most other mods. As long as there are no key binding conflicts or large Player camera changes.

## Installation

Follow the instructions in either the Toast Puck Modding discord or through the official BepInx documentation to install the mod loader.

### Recommendation:

- Create a new instance of your Puck game installation to avoid corrupting the main files.
- Copy the Puck folder under steamapps/common and rename the new folder PuckModded.
- Go into steam and at the bottom left corner click `Add a Game` then `Add a Non-Steam Game...`.
- Navigate to the new PuckModded folder and select the `Puck.exe` file.
- Make sure your new PuckModded instance also has BepInx installed.
  - To make it a bit easier to find in your steam library, right-click the Puck modded game and select Properties. You can then rename the entry to 'PuckModded', that way it shows up separately from 'Puck'.
- Download the `IFeelLeftOut.dll` file under GitHub releases and place in your BepInx plugins folder.
- After the mod is installed, launch the game.

When you are either Blue or Red goalie, pressing F1 will change your camera to the view of the opposing offensive zone.
